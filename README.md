### [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/)
Spring Dataâ€™s mission is to provide a familiar and consistent, Spring-based programming model for data access while still retaining the special traits of the underlying data store. 

It makes it easy to use data access technologies, relational and non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud-based data services. This is an umbrella project which contains many subprojects that are specific to a given database. The projects are developed by working together with many of the companies and developers that are behind these exciting technologies.
